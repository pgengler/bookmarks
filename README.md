This is a simple web app for tracking (web) bookmarks. It started out years ago before bookmark-syncing features were available for browsers, and I still prefer to have a standalone place for these because it works without having to set anything up in a new browser.

This project is currently incomplete and if you try using it as it stands now you're likely to be sorely disappointed.
